//Types of Iterators:
//1. Input Iterator -> Read one-way, one-pass (only read, 
//only moves forward, one pass)
//2. Output Iterator -> Write one way, one-pass (only write, only moves forward, one pass)
//3. Forward Iterator -> Read/Write one-way, multi-pass (read and write, 
//only moves forward, supports multiple passes pass)
//4. Forward Iterator -> Read/Write two-way, multi-pass (read and write, 
//moves forward and backward, supports multiple passes pass)
//4. Random Access Iterator -> Read/write anywhere (read and write, 
//able to access any element by index, supports multiple passes pass)
